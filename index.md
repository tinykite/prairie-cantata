f the great inland grass sea that was the North American prairie, one percent remains in its original form. But even diminished, drained of water, sown with corn and soybeans, decimated of bison, tugged apart by towns, highways and railroads, the prairie pulls at your heart. Its subtle beauty evokes wonder. You notice animals, insects, blooming flowers, the four strong winds, strange landforms, ancient lakebeds. You ask: _Why is this here? What happened?_
