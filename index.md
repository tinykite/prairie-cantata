f the great inland grass sea that was the North American prairie, one percent remains in its original form. But even diminished, drained of water, sown with corn and soybeans, decimated of bison, tugged apart by towns, highways and railroads, the prairie pulls at your heart. Its subtle beauty evokes wonder. You notice animals, insects, blooming flowers, the four strong winds, strange landforms, ancient lakebeds. You ask: _Why is this here? What happened?_

The Prairie Cantata is a meditation on the natural history, geography and geology of the Great Plains for chorus and nyckelharpe by composer Marya Hart. This work is supported by the artist-in-residence program of [Springboard for the Arts](https://springboardforthearts.org) in Fergus Falls, Minnesota.

The work-in-progress will be performed by an eight-voice chorus directed by Jerry Rubino, as a production of [Nautilus Music-Theater's](http://www.nautilusmusictheater.org) Rough Cuts program.
